Yes! Your test ran successfully. ðŸŽ‰

Hereâ€™s what happened:

PyTest found and executed your test file (login_test.py).
Collected 3 test cases from the file.
All 3 tests passed (... represents successful test execution).
Total execution time was 0.06 seconds.
Everything looks perfect! âœ… Do you need help with understanding the test results or improving the test cases?
