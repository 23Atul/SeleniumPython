Yes! Your test ran successfully. 🎉

Here’s what happened:

PyTest found and executed your test file (login_test.py).
Collected 3 test cases from the file.
All 3 tests passed (... represents successful test execution).
Total execution time was 0.06 seconds.
Everything looks perfect! ✅ Do you need help with understanding the test results or improving the test cases?
