# dropdown in html can be creaded using select and option tags

# <select >
#     <option value = "cricket" > Cricket < /option >
#     <option value = "football" > Football < /option >
#     <option value = "tennis" > Tennis < /option >
#     <option value = "badminton" > Badminton < /option >
# </select >

# if dropdown is made using select tag then we can use select_by_index() method. 
# if the given element is not a select tag then an UnexpectedNameException is thrown.


# dropdown can also be created using div and span where no select and option tags are used
# always inspect and check whether the dropdown is made using SELECT tag or div and span


there are many ways by which we can select the dropdown.
1. select_by_index() --> selects the 1st option in the select dropdown.
2. select_by_value() --> <option value="option2">Option 2</option>
3. select_by_visible_text() --> selects the provided value from the dropdown

select_by_index(1)  selects the 1st option in the select dropdown.
select_by_value("option2")  <option value="option2">Option 2</option>
select_by_visible_text("Option 3")  selects the provided value from the dropdown


impoeting Select class --> from selenium.webdriver.support.select import Select


There are many dropdowns that allow us to select multiple values as well
