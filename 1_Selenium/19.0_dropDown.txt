# dropdown in html can be creaded using select and option tags

# <select >
#     <option value = "cricket" > Cricket < /option >
#     <option value = "football" > Football < /option >
#     <option value = "tennis" > Tennis < /option >

# if dropdown is made using select tag then we can use select_by_index() method. 
# if the given element is not a select tag then an UnexpectedNameException is thrown.


# dropdown can also be created using div and span where no select and option tags are used
# always inspect and check whether the dropdown is made using SELECT tag or div and span
