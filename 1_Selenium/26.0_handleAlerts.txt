handling popups or alerts are different from just inspecting and copying xpath.

JavaScript Popup Boxes
they are mainly of 3 types
------------------------------
1. Alert Box
An alert box is often used if you want to make sure information comes through to the user.
When an alert box pops up, the user will have to click "OK" to proceed.
window.alert("sometext");

eg. 
alert("I am an alert box!");
---------------------------------------------------

2. Confirm Box
A confirm box is often used if you want the user to verify or accept something.
When a confirm box pops up, the user will have to click either "OK" or "Cancel" to proceed.
If the user clicks "OK", the box returns true. If the user clicks "Cancel", the box returns false.
window.confirm("sometext");

eg. 
if (confirm("Press a button!")) {
  txt = "You pressed OK!";
} else {
  txt = "You pressed Cancel!";
}
-----------------------------------------------------

3. Prompt Box
A prompt box is often used if you want the user to input a value before entering a page.
When a prompt box pops up, the user will have to click either "OK" or "Cancel" to proceed after entering an input value.
If the user clicks "OK" the box returns the input value. If the user clicks "Cancel" the box returns null.
window.prompt("sometext","defaultText");

eg. 
let person = prompt("Please enter your name", "Harry Potter");
let text;
if (person == null || person == "") {
  text = "User cancelled the prompt.";
} else {
  text = "Hello " + person + "! How are you today?";
}
-----------------------------------------------------------


once we click on button and popup comes, just like frames, in popup also we need to switch window to access popups
selenium gives few class/methods to handle popups

--> driver.switch_to.alert.accept()  # accept the alert ie. click on OK

--> driver.switch_to.alert.dismiss()  # dismiss the alert is. click on CANCEL

--> driver.switch_to.alert.send_keys("keys") # used to send required keys in Prompt Box.


driver.switch_to.alert.text() # prints the text written in popup box


we can even write the same code using different way
import Alert

--> Alert(driver).accept()
--> Alert(driver).dismiss()
--> Alert(driver).send_keys("keys)
