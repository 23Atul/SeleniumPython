# we have seen many a times some part of the webpage is hidden and comes to sight when a perticular action is perfomed. 

# is_displayed()

when any web element is hidden, then there are 2 possibilities.

1. the element is present in DOM and its styling is done as display=none when hidden and display=block when button is pressed.
eg- # https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_toggle_hide_show.asp
# in this toggle hide show a message comes only when a button is pressed.
style="display: block;"
style="display: none;"

2. the element is not present in the DOM and when button is pressed or condition is satisfied the DOM creates it and destroyes it accordingly.
eg- # https://www.yatra.com/hotels
# in this option for age of child comes only when we increase the value of number of child from 0.


so we cannot use is_displayed() method in 2nd case as it will return the exception.
