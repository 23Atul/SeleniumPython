7.2. Action Chains
ActionChains are a way to automate low level interactions such as mouse movements, 
mouse button actions, key press, and context menu interactions. 
This is useful for doing more complex actions like hover over and drag and drop.

action chain helps us to chain many actions together like,
move_to_element -> double click -> click
so these actions get queued up one after another
to make these action do their job one after another at the end we write .perform()


1. click(on_element: WebElement | None = None)
Clicks an element.

2. click_and_hold(on_element: WebElement | None = None)
Holds down the left mouse button on an element.

3. context_click(on_element: WebElement | None = None)
ActionChains

4. double_click(on_element: WebElement | None = None)
Double-clicks an element.


5. drag_and_drop(source: WebElement, target: WebElement)
Holds down the left mouse button on the source element, 
then moves to the target element and releases the mouse button.
source: The element to mouse down.
target: The element to mouse up.


6. drag_and_drop_by_offset(source: WebElement, xoffset: int, yoffset: int)
Holds down the left mouse button on the source element, then moves to the target offset and releases the mouse button.
source: The element to mouse down.
xoffset: X offset to move to.
yoffset: Y offset to move to.


7. key_down(value: str, element: WebElement | None = None)
Sends a key press only, without releasing it. Should only be used with modifier keys (Control, Alt and Shift).
value: The modifier key to send. Values are defined in Keys class.
element: The element to send keys. If None, sends a key to current focused element.


8. key_up(value: str, element: WebElement | None = None)
Releases a modifier key.
value: The modifier key to send. Values are defined in Keys class.
element: The element to send keys. If None, sends a key to current focused element.



9. move_to_element(to_element: WebElement)
Moving the mouse to the middle of an element.


10. pause(seconds: float | int) → ActionChains
Pause all inputs for the specified duration in seconds.

11. perform()
Performs all stored actions.

12. release(on_element: WebElement | None = None)
Releasing a held mouse button on an element.

13. scroll_to_element(element: WebElement) → ActionChains
If the element is outside the viewport, scrolls the bottom of the element to the bottom of the viewport.

14. send_keys(*keys_to_send: str) → ActionChains
Sends keys to current focused element.
