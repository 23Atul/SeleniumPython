Similar to handling auto suggestion, here also we get 2 cases.
1st in which we can select any date by brute force way ie. hard code the date and copy its xpath and perorm any operation on it.
2nd way is to select automate the calender so that it can choose any dynamic date provided.




1st 

class DemohandleCalendar:

    def handleCalendar(self):

        driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=ChromeService(ChromeDriverManager().install()))
        driver.get("https://www.yatra.com/")

        d_date = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "//div[@class='css-w7k25o']")
        d_date.click()

        all_dates = driver.find_elements(By.XPATH, "//div[contains(@aria-label,'Choose Wednesday, March 12th, 2025')]//span[contains(@aria-label,'MAHA SHIVARATHIRI')]")
// giving hardcoded value

        all_dates.click()


findbyXpath = DemohandleCalendar()
findbyXpath.handleCalendar()




we should avoid ther hard coded value, 2nd case shows how to handle dynamic value.
